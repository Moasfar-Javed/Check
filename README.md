### Description

Check is a mobile application developed using Google’s Flutter framework allowing it to be cross-platform. The app’s backend server and database storage are deployed over the cloud on a virtual machine on Microsoft Azure. The app on the user end communicates over HTTP protocol and makes requests to the server by using RESTful APIs. This app allows users to make, organize and store their important tasks, reminders, events and notes for better productivity and time management. All the user’s data is stored on a remote server, this combined with flutter’s ability to make cross-platform applications means that users can access their data on any platform.
